# üè™ JPA - Java Persistence API

---

## Description

The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a standard specification for object-relational mapping in Java, providing a framework for managing relational data in applications. It allows developers to map Java objects to database tables and define how data should be persisted, retrieved, and queried using annotations or XML configuration. JPA abstracts the underlying database interactions, enabling developers to work with database data through Java objects. Implementations of JPA, such as [Hibernate][hibernate-doc], EclipseLink, and OpenJPA, offer additional functionalities and optimizations while adhering to the JPA standard.
