## Description

Hibernate is a common ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework for mapping Java objects to database tables, allowing 
developers to perform database operations using Java objects instead of SQL queries. It offers features like automatic 
SQL generation, transaction management, lazy loading, and caching to enhance performance and productivity. Integrated 
seamlessly with Spring Boot, Hibernate simplifies configuration and leverages Springâ€™s robust transaction management. 
This combination allows for efficient, maintainable, and scalable data-driven Java applications.
