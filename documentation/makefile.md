# üìù Makefile

## Description

A [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) is a special file used by the `make` build automation 
tool to compile and manage projects. It defines a set of rules to specify how to derive the target program (or output) 
from the source files. Each rule consists of a target, dependencies, and a recipe. The target is the file to be 
generated, the dependencies are files needed to create the target, and the recipe contains the commands to be executed. 
Makefiles are essential for automating the build process, ensuring that only the necessary parts of a project are 
recompiled, thus
saving time and reducing errors.
