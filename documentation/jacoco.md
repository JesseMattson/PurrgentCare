## Description


[JaCoCo][jacoco-article] (Java Code Coverage) is a popular code coverage library for Java projects. It helps developers 
measure how much of their codebase is exercised by automated tests. JaCoCo tracks which lines of code are executed 
during test runs and generates reports showing the percentage of code coverage. This information is valuable for 
assessing the effectiveness of test suites and identifying areas of code that may need more testing.
