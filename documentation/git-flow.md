## üìñ Sample git flow on this project

**Sample story**: Implement new feature for etc...

#### Logical steps with terminal commands:
1. Get current base branch
   1. ```git checkout main```
   2. ```git pull```
2. Create branch from base branch
   1. ```git checkout -b feature/{feature_name}```
3. Perform code changes to meet [Definition of Done](Definition-Of-Done.md)
4. Verify files to commit changes
   1. ```git status```
   2. Review output for changes
5. Add changes to be committed in each commit
   1. ```git add {filename}``` for each file
6. Commit changes that were added with a descriptive message
   1. ```git commit -m {descriptive_message}```
7. Push changes to remote branch in Github
   1. ```git push origin feature/{feature_name}```

**Sample story**: Resume work on new feature

#### Logical steps with terminal commands:
1. Get current base branch
   1. ```git checkout main```
   2. ```git pull```
2. Switch to existing branch
   1. ```git checkout feature/{feature_name}```
3. Merge main into feature branch (if rebase required)
   1. ```git merge main```
4. Perform code changes to meet [Definition of Done](Definition-Of-Done.md)
5. Verify files to commit changes
   1. ```git status```
   2. Review output for changes
6. Add changes to be committed in each commit
   1. ```git add {filename}``` for each file
7. Commit changes that were added with a descriptive message
   1. ```git commit -m {descriptive_message}```
8. Push changes to remote branch in Github
   1. ```git push origin feature/{feature_name}```

** All commands above are terminal based commands. For GUI usage in IntelliJ see [documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-git-integration.html)
